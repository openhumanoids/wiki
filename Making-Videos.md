Director has built in video capture tools (on the right side is a movie camera):
- 'Lock View Size' to 1280x720
- hit 'Record Video Frames'
- then convert the still images to a movie AND COMPRESSES IT!

10-15mb / min should be possible.

That's pretty good but I sometimes use handbrake to conver that movie (an mp4) to an m4v using handbrake:

Which makes it smaller again. (Certainly use handbrake if doing a screen capture with record-my-desktop)
